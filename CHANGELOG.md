# GHEtool's Change Log and future developments
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file including planned future developments.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [2.1.2] - [expected] feb 2023

### Added
- Coaxial pipes
- Variable temperature sizing (at least in the code version)
- Reimplemented size by length and width

## [2.1.1] - [expected] jan 2023

### Added
- Added NavigationToolbar to figure (issue #55)

### Changed
- Created a new structure for the package, thereby splitting the main_py.file into more subclasses.
- Create a class for the custom g-functions.
- Speed improvements in JIT calculation. Up until now, the sizing of borefields required three steps: calculate the new size, update the borefield depth and calculate the gfunctions.
However, if the new size is close to the old one, the gfunctions will not differ that much (<1%) and a lot of speed can be gained by keeping them constant.
This effect is shown in a new validation file: [speed_improvement_JIT](/docs/sources/code/Validation/speed_improvement_JIT.rst).
- Changed default simulation period in GUI to 40 years as advised by BREEAM (issue 65)

### Fixed
- The hourly_heating_load_on_the_borefield and hourly_cooling_load_on_the_borefield are now correctly calculated.
- When an hourly temperature profile is plotted after an optimise_load_profile optimisation, the hourly load on the borefield (and not the entire hourly load) is shown.
- Correct conversion from hourly to monthly load (issue 62)

## [2.1.0] - 2022-11-30

### Added
- Documentation with ReadTheDocs
- GUI Documentation
- Changelog
- New features in the GUI

### Changed
- GUI workflow to be simpler
- precalculated data is removed
- general speed improvements

### Removed
- size by length and width for it is not compatible with the just-in-time calculation of the g-functions.


## [2.0.6] - 2022-10-07

### Added
- new functionalities for g-function calculation (inherited from pygfunction) are implemented

### Changed
- just-in-time calculation of g-functions is included (and will be expanded later)
- custom borefields can be way faster calculated

### Fixed
- Hyperlinks in PyPi should work now
- Sizing by length and width had problems with temperatures below the minimum temperature


## [2.0.5] - 2022-08-31

### Added
- Hourly sizing method (L4) is implemented
- Hourly plotting method
- Volumetric heat capacity is included in the ground data


### Changed 
- Implemented numpy arrays everywhere
- Implemented convolution instead of matrix multiplication
- New implementation for L3 sizing


### Fixed
- No more problems with iteration (L2) and sub 1m depth fields
- Fixed bug in main_functionalities example

### Varia
- New validation document for the effective thermal borehole resistance, comparison with EED

## [2.0.4] - 2022-08-17

### Fixed 
- Final JOSS paper update

## [2.0.3] - 2022-08-12

### Added
- Variable ground temperature
- Sizing with dynamic Rb*

### Fixed 
- General bug fixes

### Changed
- Sizing setup with more streamlined sizing options

## [2.0.2] - 2022-06-12

### Added
- Included a function (and example) on sizing a borefield by length and width

## [2.0.1] - 2022-06-12

### Added
- Included a pytest document to check if package is correctly installed

## [2.0.0] - 2022-04-01

### Added
- GUI
- Borehole thermal resistance (based on the pygfunction package)

### Changed
- More documentation and examples


## [1.0.1] - 2021-12-11

### Changed
- longer simulation period up to 100 years

### Fixed 
- fixed bug in interpolation
